            "description": "<h3>The Breed History</h3><p>The origins of this breed are easily traced from the 19th century forward in Siberia. The Chukchi people in northeastern Asia were likely the original breeders of these hardy dogs. In Alaska, imports were used for sled dog racing in 1909. One of the famed serum dog teams that delivered life-saving serum from Neoma to Nome Alaska during the diphtheria outbreak of 1925 consisted of Siberians. The AKC recognized the breed in 1930.</p><h3>Breeding for Function</h3><p>The Chukchi people of Northeast Asia developed this breed for use as a sled dog. Emphasis was on endurance and tolerance of cold but selection also focused on those dogs requiring minimal food intake. They have been used extensively in Antarctic expeditions, and in search and rescue units during the Second World War. Today, they are most commonly seen in a companionship role, but they are still found out on the trail, ski-joring and pulling sleds.</p><h3>Physical Characteristics</h3><ul><li><b>Height at Withers:</b> female 20-22\" (51-56 cm), male 21-23.5\" (53-59.5 cm).</li><li><b>Weight:</b> females 35-50 lb (16-22.5 kg), males 45-60 lb (20.5-27 kg).</li><li><b>Coat:</b> Medium-length, double coat is very dense, soft and wooly in the undercoat, and outer coat hairs are straight. Markings on the head are variable, and the base color varies widely from black through white, and white legs and chest are common. Longevity: 11-14 years</li><li><b>Points of Conformation:</b> The Siberian Husky is medium in size, compact in conformation, with a very dense fur. Gait is agile and quick, smooth and ground covering with little apparent effort. His bushy tail is erect when alert, carried over the back in a sickle shape, but not deviated to the sides. The muzzle is straight in profile, gradually tapering, with a well-defined stop. Almond-shaped eyes are blue, brown, parti-colored or odd-eyed (one of each). They are slightly slanted upwards laterally, and are moderately wide-set. Ears are set high, triangular and medium in size, standing erect, and have semi-pointed tips and thick leather. Lips are tight and close, and the nose can have variable pigmentation as long as it is synchronized with coat color. The neck is medium in length and muscling with a slight arch. The thorax is deep and somewhat laterally flattened; ribs are well sprung. The topline is level. They possess straight limbs which are moderately boned and muscled. Foreleg dewclaws may be removed, while the rear ones are usually removed. Feet are oval, medium sized and possess plenty of fur between the toes. Pads are thick.</li></ul>"

Some historians believe the dog was crossed with a hairless breed from the Orient at some point. In the travels of Columbus, a similar small mute dog was noted in Cuba. This type of dog was highly treasured in Toltec and Aztec civilizations, so much so that they were often buried with their masters. It is unlikely that the origin of the breed was just in the Chihuahua area of Mexico, but since many of the foundation dogs that were exported in the mid 1800s came from this state, the name was selected. Longhaired varieties may have resulted from Yorkshire Terrier or Papillion crosses.

In Buddhism, the lion is a symbol of Buddha, and this may be the origin of the special position the dog held since in legend, these dogs were thought to originate from union of monkey and lion. A favorite of the Imperial families, a theft of one of these dogs was punishable by death. Earliest records indicate the breed was distinctive by the 8th century. First specimens arrived in Britain in the year1860; one was given to Queen Victoria.

            "description": "<h3>The Breed History</h3><p>Though one of the most popular modern dog breeds, the origins of the Beagle are obscure. Some reports place them in England before Roman times. Many of the early reports date to the 1300s. It is thought that their early lineage included crosses out to other scent hounds, and Foxhounds are variably thought to be derived from the Beagle as a result of those crosses, or perhaps Foxhounds were crossed back to be an early influence on beagle type. The mid 18th century reports indicate two types of hare hunting hounds. The modern beagle apparently derives from the North Country Beagle. The modern American lines were first imported in the 1860s and 1880s. The breed name origins are also obscure, with deviation from Olde English, French or Celtic being cited; the derivative may be from roots such as \"begle\", \"beag\", or \"begele\".</p><h3>Breeding for Function</h3><p>As hunters, they are courageous and have a great deal of stamina. They hunt equally well in packs, braced (pairs) or solo, though they are most commonly hunted in packs. They are scent hounds and were bred to hunt hare and rabbit. Today, they are most commonly companion dogs.</p><h3>Physical Characteristics</h3><ul><li>Height at Withers: <ol><li><b>Thirteen Inch:</b> up to 13\" high.</li><li><b>Fifteen Inch:</b> 13-15\" high (maximum height 15\" in the United States, 16\" in England).</li></ol></li><li>Weight: Thirteen inch variety is generally less than 20 lb (9 kg), Fifteen inch variety is generally 20-30 lb (9-13.5 kg).</li><li>Coat: The hard, short-medium outer coat hairs may be of any hound colors.

They were brought to America around the year 1925. The name derives from the German word for nose (schnauzer). The AKC recognized this breed in 1933.</p><h3>Breeding for Function</h3><p>These dogs were widely used on the farm to control vermin such as rats, but the temperament of this breed varies from the classic terrier.

            "description": "<h3>The Breed History</h3><p>\"Poodle\" likely derives from Pudel, a German term describing one who plays and splashes in water or puddles. The exact lines of genetic origin are obscured, but ancient breeds such as the Irish water spaniel, Rough haired water dog and others contribute to the type, and perhaps the first of the smaller types of poodles originated by crosses with terrier type for use in truffle hunting. German history records poodle type dogs in the 15th century. The toy version of poodle first widely entered the history record in the 18th century. Very early records in the Mediterranean place poodle type dogs in the first century. Though often referred to as the French poodle, the breed is not though to have originated there. AKC recognition occurred in 1887.</p><h3>Breeding for Function</h3><p>Originally these dogs were bred as gundogs for waterfowl hunting, as a water retriever. The origins of the fancy coat clips trace back to early times when the hunters clipped the bulk of the dog coat so that they would dry quickly, and to minimize the weight of the wet hair for ease of swimming, but they left fur over bony prominences to help insulate joints from the cold. In France, the dog was also used extensively as a circus dog. Toy, miniature, and standard poodles are all popular as companion dogs, and the smaller types were bred down in size from the standard; it was the larger standard poodle that was originally used for hunting. Guide dogs, therapy dogs, police work and obedience and agility competitions round out some of their modern functions.</p><h3>Physical Characteristics</h3><ul><li>All three types share the same breed standard, only the size and weight varies between the three.</li><li><b>Toy</b></li><ul><li><b>Height at Withers:</b> female up to 10\" (25.4 cm), male up to 10\" (25.4 cm)</li><li><b>Weight:</b> females 6-9 lb (2.5-4 kg), males 6-9 lb (2.5-4 kg).</li></ul><li><b>Miniature</b></li><ul><li><b>Height at Withers:</b> female 10-15\" (25.5-38 cm), male 10-15\" (25.5-38 cm)</li><li><b>Miniature Weight:</b> females 15-17 lb (7-8 kg), males 15-17 lb (7-8 kg).</li></ul></ul>"
